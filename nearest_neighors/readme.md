Unsupervised nearest neighbors:
    => foundation of many other learing methods, notably manifold learing and spectral clustering.

Supervised neighbors-based learning:
    => 1. classification for data with discret labels.
    => 2. regression for data with continuous lables.


Principle:
    => find a predefined number of training samples closest in distance to the new point.
    => predict the lable from these
